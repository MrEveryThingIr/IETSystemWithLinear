# Continuous Ideal-v1 Handoff

## Mission

Implement the full accepted Ideal-v1 roadmap continuously on GitHub with remote automated gates at every milestone and deferred owner-local/browser acceptance.

This reconstruction intentionally removes the unused AI assistance / Development Origin runtime while retaining the new Access Invitation + Intent Registry product work.

## Current objective

Phase 15 is integrated on `integration/ideal-v1` at merge checkpoint `09c1c792baa5116645f7795887d59fecafe3fc3f`.

Phase 16 — Commitment + Fulfillment — is runtime-green on `feat/ideal-v1-16-commitment-fulfillment` at `67b986cce96f7d6e72db811045a9c1a01c581ddb` / CI `36093668972` (495 tests / 2989 assertions), pending documentation closure/integration.

After Phase 16 integration, continue directly with **Phase 17 — Financial Obligation + Settlement bridge** from the integration trunk.

Persistent Phase 16 boundary: ContractVersion is agreement truth; Commitment is obligation truth; Planner/Occurrence is schedule/execution-time truth; Fulfillment/review is actual-performance truth. Accepted Fulfillment must not silently create Financial Obligation, Accounting posting, Settlement, payment, ownership or employment truth. Phase 17 owns explicit financial consequences.

Do not reintroduce AI runtime until the dedicated later AI milestone.

## Persistent product rules

- Content is one independent versioned system; GroupSpace is only one Context kind.
- Content has a home/origin Context for authoring/authorization but may be presented/referenced elsewhere.
- normal presentation may follow the current published revision; evidence must pin an exact published revision/target.
- Contexts compose modules; they do not require duplicate module tables.
- user journeys progressively activate capabilities rather than selecting a giant universal type.
- Need/Offer is intent, not Match/Contract/obligation.
- Relationship is an explicit direct coordination boundary, not Group Membership, Contract, ownership, employment, financing rights or payment.
- Relationship Context is writable only after explicit participant consent and becomes read-only when terminal.
- Conversation is collaboration evidence, not authoritative acceptance.
- finance uses explicit domain-event → obligation → accounting actions; balances are derived.
- user-facing UX uses plain actions while specialized kernels retain authority.
- Alice/Bob/Carol/Diego examples are canonical across docs/tests.

## Interruption recovery

If interrupted:

1. inspect latest `integration/ideal-v1` SHA and CI;
2. inspect active feature branch/report if one exists;
3. never restart from chat memory;
4. update this handoff after each remotely integrated milestone.
