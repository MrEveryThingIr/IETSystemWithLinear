# Continuous Ideal-v1 Handoff

## Mission

Implement the full accepted Ideal-v1 roadmap continuously on GitHub with remote automated gates at every milestone and deferred owner-local/browser acceptance.

This reconstruction intentionally removes the unused AI assistance / Development Origin runtime while retaining the new Access Invitation + Intent Registry product work.

## Current objective

Phase 12 is integrated on `integration/ideal-v1` at merge checkpoint `6769b8632084f33a464145ae7501f2a4e88f5531`.

Phase 13 — Personal Accounting v1 — is remote-green on `feat/ideal-v1-13-personal-accounting` at final runtime checkpoint `c5a45f7d4178637e322855e71318709610e835b8` / CI `36042662030` (469 tests / 2714 assertions), pending integration.

After Phase 13 integration, continue directly with **Phase 14 — Proposal + Negotiation** from the integration trunk.

Persistent Phase 13 boundary: Accounting v1 is Personal Context money truth. Relationship collaboration, Planner state, Conversation wording or Content prose does not create shared debt, obligation, invoice, settlement, ownership or payment truth. Those bridges require later explicit Financial Obligation + Settlement actions.

Do not reintroduce AI runtime until the dedicated later AI milestone.

## Persistent product rules

- Content is one independent versioned system; GroupSpace is only one Context kind.
- Content has a home/origin Context for authoring/authorization but may be presented/referenced elsewhere.
- normal presentation may follow the current published revision; evidence must pin an exact published revision/target.
- Contexts compose modules; they do not require duplicate module tables.
- user journeys progressively activate capabilities rather than selecting a giant universal type.
- Need/Offer is intent, not Match/Contract/obligation.
- Relationship is an explicit direct coordination boundary, not Group Membership, Contract, ownership, employment, financing rights or payment.
- Relationship Context is writable only after explicit participant consent and becomes read-only when terminal.
- Conversation is collaboration evidence, not authoritative acceptance.
- finance uses explicit domain-event → obligation → accounting actions; balances are derived.
- user-facing UX uses plain actions while specialized kernels retain authority.
- Alice/Bob/Carol/Diego examples are canonical across docs/tests.

## Interruption recovery

If interrupted:

1. inspect latest `integration/ideal-v1` SHA and CI;
2. inspect active feature branch/report if one exists;
3. never restart from chat memory;
4. update this handoff after each remotely integrated milestone.
